# Unofficial Mapbox GL Native bindings for Qt QML

These bindings are mainly developed for supporting Mapbox GL Native
for platforms that lack Qt/QML 5.9 support, such as Sailfish OS. If
you have access to QtLocation 5.9, please consider using the official
Mapbox GL plugin.

The code is based on QtLocation 5.9 Mapbox GL plugin, Qt/QML bindings
developed as a part of Mapbox GL Native by Mapbox team before merging
QML bindings with QtLocation. Please note that the origin of each file
is noted in the comment at the top of the file. 

Since QtLocation 5.9 is distributed with LGPL3.0, the code written for
these bindings is distributed with the same license. The original code
developed as a part of Mapbox GL Native has a license at
https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/blob/master/LICENSE.md
